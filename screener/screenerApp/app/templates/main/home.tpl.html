            <p>Thank you for your interest in our research! The purpose of this study is to better understand the specific factors that contribute to individual differences in language ability.</p>
            <p>If you agree to participate, we would like you to complete a series of online tasks that measure language ability. Tasks include repeating sentences, describing photographs, and producing words that fit into specific categories. At the end of the survey you will be asked to provide your contact information if you wish to be entered into the drawing for a $50 Amazon gift card.</p>
            <p>If you do not wish to provide your contact information, your results will be completely anonymous and we will not recontact you for payment or future studies. If you do wish to provide your contact information, we will keep this information confidential. You will be assigned a Participant ID and your results will be tied to this ID rather than your contact information. Only approved members of our research team will have access to your contact information, as well as federal regulatory agencies and the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board (a committee that reviews and approves research studies) if they inspect and copy records pertaining to this research. If we write a report about this study we will do so in such a way that you cannot be identified.</p>
            <p>There are no known risks from being in this study, and you will not benefit personally. However we hope that others may benefit in the future from what we learn as a result of this study.</p>
            <p>Taking part in this research study is completely voluntary. If you decide not to be in this study, or if you stop participating at any time, you won’t be penalized or lose any benefits for which you otherwise qualify. To avoid participating in the study you may close out of this window at any point.</p>

            This assessment will measure several aspects of language ability.  It will take about 15 minutes. 
            <br/><br/>
            You will hear audio, and audio will be recorded as you speak in some parts of the assessment, so it’s best if you are in a private or secluded area as you participate.
